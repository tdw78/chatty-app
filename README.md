## Chatty App

### Problem Addressed:  There are a lot of people who have family and friends that live too far away to stay in touch.  Without an easy and fast way to communicate, relationships can fade.

### Solution: Chatty App provides a platform for those users who have friends and family living hundreds if not thousands of miles away to stay connected.  Chatty App allows users to send and recieve text messages instantly with multiple users at a time.

### To build this app, I used Node, Express, Passport and PostgreSQL and Bootstrap.

>If I had more time to work on this project, I would have definitely spend more time working on the design and layout with Bootstrap.  If I didn't run out of time, I would have loved to integrate socket.io so the app would update in real time.  I would also have the user's name appear next to the message that they sent instead of just their user ID.

>To use this application, you must first create an account with your name, email and a password.  After creating your account, you are able to then navigate to the message page and start sending messages.

>In order to get this application running, you must first get the database.  Then, in your terminal, navigate to the root of the application and run the command 'npm start' to start the server.  After that, open your browser and enter the url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/.
